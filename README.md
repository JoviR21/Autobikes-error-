## Autobikes.ID: A React Next.js Project for Purwadhika Bootcamp Code Challange

**Project Overview**

Autobikes.ID is a company profile website and motorcycle dealership/importer in Indonesia. It was created as a capstone project for the Purwadhika Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp's Code Challenge. This project marked my first experience building a website using React and the Next.js framework, as well as integrating a Headless CMS.

* **Next.js:** The React framework used for building the website.
* **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI:** For styling the user interface.
* **TypeScript:** For adding static typing to the JavaScript codebase.
* **Contentful:** The Headless CMS used to manage content.
